## üîÑ Data Flow Architecture

The pipeline handles data through several key stages:

- **Data Ingestion**:
  - Transactional data is streamed into Kafka topics.
  - Schema Registry validates data formats using Avro schemas.

- **Processing Layer**:
  - Apache Spark consumes data from Kafka topics.
  - Real-time aggregations and transformations are applied.
  - Processed results are published back to Kafka.

- **Storage & Visualization**:
  - Aggregated data is stored in PostgreSQL.
  - BI tools connect to PostgreSQL for real-time visualization.

**Key Relationships**:
- Kafka acts as the central messaging backbone.
- Schema Registry ensures data compatibility across systems.
- Spark provides the computational power for real-time analytics.
- PostgreSQL serves as the persistent data store for BI integration.

## üî• Pipeline Components
The data pipeline is structured into three major components:
### Event Streaming (Kafka & Schema Registry)
- Transactional data is ingested into Kafka topics.
- Schema Registry ensures data format compliance.
- Tables:
  - Raw transaction topics
  - Validated transaction topics

### Real-Time Processing (Apache Spark)
- Data is processed, transformed, and aggregated in real-time.
- Streaming operations include:
  - Windowed aggregations
  - Enrichment with reference data
  - Pattern detection

### Data Storage & Visualization (PostgreSQL)
- Final processed data is stored for analysis:
  - Transaction aggregates
  - Time-series metrics
  - Business KPIs

**Highlights**:
- **Throughput**: 3,000 transactions per second
- **Latency**: Sub-second processing time
- **Usage**: Real-time dashboards, alerts, and automated actions
